"""Hardcoded values for the standalone SDDC spec builder.

Everything in this module is a value our automation pins rather than
derives from the environment. The interactive CLI
(``sddc_spec_builder.py``) surfaces
each of these as a default the operator can accept with Enter, and
prompts for the site-specific pieces (FQDN, CIDRs, product version,
hostnames, passwords) that aren't knowable up front.

Source of truth: these mirror
``orchestrator/evs_environment/sddc_spec_builder.py`` so a spec produced
here matches what the full automation would POST.
