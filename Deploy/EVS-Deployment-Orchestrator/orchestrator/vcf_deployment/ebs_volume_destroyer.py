"""Detach and delete the EBS volume that hosted the VCF Installer VMFS.

Phase 2's ``ebs_volume_manager.EbsVolumeManager`` creates the volume
during environment provisioning, tagging it with
``ManagedBy=phase2-automation`` + ``EnvironmentId=<env>`` so we can
identify it unambiguously here. This module mirrors just the destroy
half of that lifecycle — by phase boundary the SDDC + NSX
deployment doesn't need to create EBS volumes, only release them after
the local installer VMFS has been unmounted.

Destroys are gated by tag:

  - Refuses to act on a volume that doesn't carry both
    ``ManagedBy=phase2-automation`` and ``EnvironmentId=<env>`` tags.
    Defends against accidentally deleting an operator-attached volume
    or one belonging to a sibling environment.

Idempotent: if the volume is already gone, the call returns
``{"deleted": False, "reason": "not present"}`` and the
SDDC + NSX deployment proceeds.
