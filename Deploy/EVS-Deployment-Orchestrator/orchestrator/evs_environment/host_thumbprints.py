"""Fetch SHA-256 SSL thumbprints from ESXi hosts.

VCF Installer's UI and the POST /v1/sddcs validator require an
``sslThumbprint`` on each host spec even when ``skipEsxThumbprintValidation``
is set — the server honors the skip flag, but they validate the field's
presence anyway.

Phase 2 attempts a best-effort pre-fetch during ``post-evs-sync-config`` (no
credentials needed for a public cert). The workstation often can't reach
``esxi*.<fqdn>``; when that happens the pre-fetch is skipped (non-fatal) and
Phase 3, which can reach the hosts, fetches any missing thumbprints at POST time.
