"""Fetch SHA-256 SSL thumbprints from ESXi hosts.

The VCF Installer UI (and the POST /v1/sddcs validator on 9.0.2) require an
``sslThumbprint`` on each host spec even when ``skipEsxThumbprintValidation``
is set. The server-side code honors the skip flag, but the UI and the REST
validator require the field anyway.

Phase 3 runs on a box that can reach the ESXi hosts (the Installer VM or a
VPC-internal workstation). Phase 2 attempts a best-effort pre-fetch during
``post-evs-sync-config``, but its workstation often can't resolve
``esxi*.<fqdn>``, so Phase 3 fetches any thumbprints still missing at POST
time (falling back to a placeholder if a host is unreachable from here too).
