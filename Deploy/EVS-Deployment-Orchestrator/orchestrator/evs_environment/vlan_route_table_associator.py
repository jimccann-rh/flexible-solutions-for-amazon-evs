"""Associate EVS-created VLAN subnets with Phase 1's service access route table.

EVS creates one subnet per VLAN; left alone they inherit the VPC's main route
table. We re-associate them with Phase 1's service-access RTB so every VLAN
shares the same egress path. Idempotent (already-associated subnets log
``skip``), and tolerates the race between EVS creating a subnet and it becoming
visible to ``DescribeRouteTables`` via exponential-backoff retries.
